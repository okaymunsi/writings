  Public Opinion by Walter Lippman
  
Chapter 14 - Yes or No
  SubChapter 1-2:
   Synopsis:
    
    Symbols derive their initial meaning from an autoritative figure.

    For subjects which we cannot apply our own independence to, we seek to 'multiply the authorities to whom we give a friendly hearing.'
    In debate, 'we can often judge who has won the dialecitcal victory,

      In any cooperating structure some such hierarchy exists.
      There are distinctions between the members of the machine and the rank and file.
      The distinctions are in the priviledges that are ______ to them.
      A lasting and coherant organization respects and protects these privileges and responsibilities.
      
    Personal Thoughts:
      This subchapter is disjuncted and not coherant.
      What are the number of distinctions that cleave the managing from the managed?
      The chain of privilege...
