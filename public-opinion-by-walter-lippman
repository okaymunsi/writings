  Public Opinion by Walter Lippman
  
Chapter 14 - Yes or No
   Synopsis:
    
    Symbols derive their initial meaning from an autoritative figure.
    Time, Distance, Familiarity force people to judge and rely on credibility of authoritative figures representing issues.
    For subjects which we cannot apply our own independence to, we seek to 'multiply the authorities to whom we give a friendly hearing.'
    In debate, 'we can often judge who has won the dialecitcal victory, 
    but we are virtually defenseless against a false premise that none of debaters has challenged, 
    or a neglected aspect hat none of them has brought into the argument'
   
   Personal Thoughts:
    Symbols carry the weight of the invoked image in the mind.
    Words are first symbols, before they are meaning.
    Blind repetition of a word puts focus on the word as a -sound- over a -symbol-,
    which distances the word as a -symbol- from its connotations in the mind,
    resulting in the percieved stripping of meaning from the word as a -sound-.
